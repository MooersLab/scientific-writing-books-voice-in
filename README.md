# Books about scientific writing as voice-in plus commands

This repository contains a csv file that has a list of books about academic writing for scientists that maps to what I call voice triggers.
You say the voice trigger and the corresponding chunk of prose is inserted into the text area of a web browser when using the Voice In Plus plug-in for Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
The commands in the csv file are uploaded into your Voice In account using the `bulk add` option in the configuration page for this plugin.

Anyway, this is a list of books that I have found useful for writing scientific articles.
