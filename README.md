# Books about scientific writing as voice-in plus commands

This repository contains a CSV file with a list of books about academic writing for scientists.
Each book is mapped to a voice trigger.
Say the voice trigger and the corresponding chunk of prose will be inserted into the text area of a web browser when using the Voice In Plus plug-in for Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
The commands in the csv file are uploaded into your Voice In account using the `bulk add` option in the configuration page for this plugin.
The book titles are in a LaTeX `\emph{}` macro to italicize them.
Replace with flanking asterisks when using Markdown.

This is a list of books I have found helpful in writing scientific articles.
